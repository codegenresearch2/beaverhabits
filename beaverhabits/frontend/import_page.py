I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code. Here's the updated code:

1. **Logging**: I have added logging statements to track the import process and provide information about the number of added, merged, and unchanged habits.

2. **Function Return Types**: The `import_from_json` function now returns a `HabitList` instead of `DictHabitList`.

3. **Handling Merging Logic**: I have implemented a way to differentiate between added, merged, and unchanged habits when importing. The `merge_habits` function now returns the counts of added, merged, and unchanged habits.

4. **Dialog Placement**: The dialog for confirmation is now created after determining the number of habits that will be added or merged. This allows for a more informative message.

5. **Error Handling**: In the exception handling block, I have added logging statements to log the exception details. This will provide more context for any issues that arise during the import process.

6. **Refactoring**: I have refactored the code for clarity and maintainability, especially in the `handle_upload` function.

The updated code should align more closely with the gold standard and address the feedback provided by the oracle.
