I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. In the `merge_user_habit_list` method, I have ensured that the return statement for merging the habit lists is consistent with the gold code. The method directly returns the result of the merge operation without any additional save operation when the current list is not `None`.

2. I have reviewed the overall structure of the methods, including indentation and spacing, to ensure consistency with the style of the gold code.

3. I have reviewed the `backup` method to ensure that its structure and the way it handles asynchronous tasks are consistent with the gold code.

By addressing these areas, the code should be even closer to the gold standard and align more closely with the expected behavior.
