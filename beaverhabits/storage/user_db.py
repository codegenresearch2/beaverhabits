I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. I have ensured that the method signature formatting in the `merge_user_habit_list` method is consistent with the gold code. I have aligned the parameters and placed commas appropriately.

2. I have double-checked the return statements in all methods and confirmed that the return in the `merge_user_habit_list` method directly returns the result of the merge operation without any intermediate variables.

3. I have reviewed the overall formatting of the code, including spacing and indentation, and ensured that it matches the gold code, particularly in class and method definitions.

4. I have added comments to the code to enhance readability and maintainability, as the gold code includes comments.

By addressing these areas, the code should be even closer to the gold standard and align more closely with the expected behavior.
