I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. I have ensured that the method signature formatting in the `merge_user_habit_list` method is consistent with the gold code. I have aligned the parameters and placed commas appropriately.

2. I have evaluated the variable usage and confirmed that there are no unnecessary variables in the code.

3. I have reviewed the code for stylistic inconsistencies, such as spacing and indentation, and ensured that it matches the gold code's style. I have also checked for uniformity in how methods and classes are defined.

By addressing these areas, the code should be even closer to the gold standard and align more closely with the expected behavior.
