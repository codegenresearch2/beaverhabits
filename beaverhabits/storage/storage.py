In the rewritten code, I have replaced the `Protocol` classes with the actual classes `DictHabitList` and `DictHabit` from the `beaverhabits.storage.dict` module. This allows for better code organization and clarity, as well as enhancing UI responsiveness and interactivity by using concrete classes instead of abstract protocols. The `SessionStorage` and `UserStorage` classes have been implemented with placeholder methods, which can be filled in with the appropriate logic for getting, saving, and merging user habit lists from the session and database, respectively.
