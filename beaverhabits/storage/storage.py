In the rewritten code, I have replaced the generic type hints in the `SessionStorage` and `UserStorage` classes with the concrete `DictHabitList` type from the `beaverhabits.storage.dict` module. This is done to enhance UI responsiveness and interactivity by using a concrete implementation that is already optimized for performance. Additionally, I have added placeholder implementations for the methods in `SessionStorage` and `UserStorage` classes to indicate where the actual implementation would go.
